# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
This document explains the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how OOP concepts are implemented in Java. These concepts are essential for writing maintainable, reusable, and scalable code.

# Overview
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions. Objects are instances of classes, which represent real-world entities. OOP focuses on four main principles:

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
These principles help in managing complexity in large software systems, making code easier to maintain, extend, and reuse. Additional essential topics, such as Serialization, File Handling, and Exception Handling, are also integral to working with Java OOP concepts effectively.
